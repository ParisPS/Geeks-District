                    Ultraman is back! After countless battles to defend the Earth, the hero was never seen again and,
                    over time, became a legend. A few decades later, Shin Hayata got married, had a son and became
                    Japan's Minister of Defense. But he and his son are a little different from ordinary people and
                    Hayata has no memory of why. When strange events reoccur in Japan, an “old new” hero will emerge and
                    many questions asked by fans over time will begin to be answered.</p>
